# 👋 Hi, I'm Vincent (rajahwu)

🎲 Game Presenter | 🛠️ Systems Architect | 🎨 Builder of Token-Driven Design Systems  
Currently exploring **Gemini + Firebase** for training apps and **token pipelines** for scalable UI.

---

## 🚀 Now Building
- **Clearline 7** → A design‑token driven system with multiple editions (Federal Flow, Tech Code, Clerical Pro, Wiki).  
- **Arithmetic Trainer** → Early prototype for structured practice loops (currently under repair, but part of the training suite).  
- **Blackjack Trainer** → Firebase + Gemini app for dealer drills, phrasebooks, and beat‑mapped training.

---

## 📌 Featured Projects
- 🔹 **Clearline 7**: Token parser + multi‑edition theming pipeline.  
- 🔹 **Arithmetic Trainer**: Lightweight practice app for repetition and cadence.  
- 🔹 **Blackjack Trainer**: AI‑assisted dealer training system.

## 🧭 Focus Areas
- Token‑driven design systems (Tailwind v4 + CSS outputs)  
- Contributor‑ready pipelines (Nx, ESLint, TypeScript, CI/CD)  
- Training frameworks (phrasebooks, beat‑mapped drills, simulation scripts)  
- Firebase + Gemini for AI‑assisted scaffolding
